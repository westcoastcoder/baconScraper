This program is my first self-directed project in Python (and otherwise, too, really). For now, its only meant as a way to build my skillset and experience.

As the name suggests, it is a webscraper that will tell you if Kevin Bacon is mentioned on a given wikipedia page. The scraper will be limited to wikipedia (for now).

Watch this space for updates on this scraper's functionality.
